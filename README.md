# Multi-view 3D Reconstruction
This repo is for our course project for the course GNR 638. We have implemented the Attsets algorithm for Multi-view 3D Reconstruction. Our project is inspired by the paper **Hyperlink**'Robust Attentional Aggregation of Deep Feature Sets for Multi-view 3D Reconstruction'. We have successfully implemented and tested the Attsets model and FASet algorithm proposed in the paper.
